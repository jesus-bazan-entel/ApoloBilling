# Frontend Design Skill

Create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces with high design quality. Use this skill when the user asks to build web components, pages, or applications. Generates creative, polished code that avoids generic AI aesthetics.

## Overview

This skill guides creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. It implements real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.

**Context**: The user provides frontend requirements: a component, page, application, or interface to build. They may include context about the purpose, audience, or technical constraints.

## Design Thinking

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a **BOLD aesthetic direction**:

- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone**: Pick an extreme aesthetic direction:
  - Brutally minimal
  - Maximalist chaos
  - Retro-futuristic
  - Organic/natural
  - Luxury/refined
  - Playful/toy-like
  - Editorial/magazine
  - Brutalist/raw
  - Art deco/geometric
  - Soft/pastel
  - Industrial/utilitarian
  - (And many others)

- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility)
- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?

### Critical Principle
Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. **Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work—the key is intentionality, not intensity.**

### Implementation Requirements

Then implement working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.) that is:
- Production-grade and functional
- Visually striking and memorable
- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view
- Meticulously refined in every detail

## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines

### Focus Areas

**Typography**
- Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting
- Avoid generic fonts (Arial, Inter, system fonts)
- Opt for distinctive, characterful font choices
- Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font

**Color & Theme**
- Commit to a cohesive aesthetic
- Use CSS variables for consistency
- Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes

**Motion**
- Use animations for effects and micro-interactions
- Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML
- Use Motion library for React when available
- Focus on high-impact moments: orchestrated page loads with staggered reveals (animation-delay)
- Use scroll-triggering and hover states that surprise

**Spatial Composition**
- Unexpected layouts
- Asymmetry and overlap
- Diagonal flow and grid-breaking elements
- Generous negative space OR controlled density

**Backgrounds & Visual Details**
- Create atmosphere and depth (not just solid colors)
- Add contextual effects and textures matching the overall aesthetic
- Apply creative forms:
  - Gradient meshes
  - Noise textures
  - Geometric patterns
  - Layered transparencies
  - Dramatic shadows
  - Decorative borders
  - Custom cursors
  - Grain overlays

### What to Avoid (Generic AI Aesthetics)

**NEVER use:**
- Overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts)
- Cliched color schemes (especially purple gradients on white)
- Predictable layouts and component patterns
- Cookie-cutter design lacking context-specific character

### Design Philosophy

- Interpret creatively and make unexpected choices genuinely designed for the context
- No design should be the same—vary between light/dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics
- NEVER converge on common choices (e.g., Space Grotesk) across generations

### Implementation Complexity

**IMPORTANT**: Match implementation complexity to aesthetic vision:
- **Maximalist designs** need elaborate code with extensive animations and effects
- **Minimalist/refined designs** need restraint, precision, and careful attention to spacing, typography, and subtle details
- Elegance comes from executing the vision well
